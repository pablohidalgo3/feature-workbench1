- His ID Wadid comes from the term 'warded'.
- Often jokes around in relation to the champion Vayne, as his given name Bae-in (배인) sounds very close to Vayne (베인) in Korean.
- When he was a member of the LCK broadcast team, he was known to criticize Pyosik. As a symbolic gesture prior to Worlds 2020, he presented Pyosik with the Korean flag that he took on stage during the Worlds 2018 semifinals.
